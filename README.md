Hello, I'm LuÃ­s! I write Java and Python (and Rust... and occasionally C++) at [AWS Game Tech](https://aws.amazon.com/gametech/) and I help people make video games.

My goal is to one day write my own OS kernel in Rust, but until then I might have to be content with [reimplementing Coreutils](https://github.com/luisonthekeyboard/reflexio) or [my own Shell](https://github.com/luisonthekeyboard/flush)...
